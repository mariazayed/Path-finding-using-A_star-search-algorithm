# Path finding using A_star search algorithm

**Note** the project was running in [eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)

This project used [A star searching algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to search for the best path between two pre-defined cities in terms of the disctance, speed, and cost

```DirectedGraph``` generates a directed graph for the set of cities and use it to find the best path
